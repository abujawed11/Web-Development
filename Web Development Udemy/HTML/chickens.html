        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild
        species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or
        cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been
        castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

        Originally raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame in China according to estimations in the study
        of the sub-haplogroup C1,[2] or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic
        period (4th–2nd centuries BC).<sup><a href="source">[2][4]</a></sup> Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
        their meat and eggs) and as pets.

        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018,[5] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[6] There are more chickens in the world than any other
        bird.[6] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language
        and literature.

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
        Asia,[7] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
        subcontinent.

        From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[8]
        Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having
        come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[9][10][11]

        In 2011 a study in genetic and archaeological[12] evidence conclude that the origin of the modern-day chicken is
        from South-East Asia. This is the area east of India and south of China.
